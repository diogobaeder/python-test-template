# python-test-template
Just an initial skeleton for Python testing - initially using TDD, then I'll add BDD support - for use in coding dojos, for example.

## Scripts
The install steps in the shell scripts were taken from [http://isnomore.net/2010/08/01/automated-python-testing-nose-and-tdaemon/](http://isnomore.net/2010/08/01/automated-python-testing-nose-and-tdaemon/)

Currently only Linux is supported by the shortcut scripts, but Mac users can have the same functionality by installing Growl - see the webpage above for how to install it.

So, first install the dependencies, running "sudo install.sh", then start the tests by running "run.sh"
